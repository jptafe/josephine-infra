# INSTRUCTIONS

the packages of Vue and Bootstrap are in the frontendfolder
and
PHP with http-foundation library are in the backend folder
to setup use the CLI to:

```
cd frontend 
npm update
npm run serve

cd ../backend/
compuser update
php -S 0.0.0.0:8090

chrome.exe --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=~/chromeTemp
```


# TODO

* We need a database
* the api does nothing, there should be a default action
* our frontend needs to test access to the backend with a http://localhsot:8090 test
